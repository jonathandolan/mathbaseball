Architecture
	Our math-baseball game is going to be implemented in Java, with a Swing GUI interface. It is going to be a desktop application, which will connect to a database server. The server will store all of the student/teacher accounts, questions answered, and questions attempted per level. The database server will also be where the teacher can look up each student's records.
	There will be two parts to the desktop application. The backend will do all of the logic for the game, such as generating questions, determining if the answers are correct or not, connecting with the database server, etc. It will not store anything permanently, but will store all of the data generated on the database server. When the application starts up, it will connect to the database server, and then ask the user for their username/password, and then query the database to see if it is a correct login, and then will only write the scores and other data to the database. The GUI will be implemented in Swing, a Java GUI framework, and will communicate with a backend on the same device to show questions, login, etc.
	The database server will supply records to the desktop application and will record each student's score for each level, questions attempted, team color, etc. It will also have a GUI implemented in Swing so that the teacher can look up the student's scores, and see what they are struggling with. This is so that the teacher can use his/her own device as the database server, so that they can look up the statistics when they aren't at school. The database server will record the following pieces of data: username/password pairs, number of questions attempted for each level, number of correct answers for each level, team color, and team name. 
Version control will be done through GitHub. All code and documentation will go into a GitHub repository, with each member of the group being a collaborator on that repository.
